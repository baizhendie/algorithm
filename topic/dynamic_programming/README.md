Dynamic Programming
======

## Steps

1. what is the meaning of `dp[i]`
2. how to do initialization
3. how you iterate that `dp`
4. what is the returning

## Space Optimization

- rolling array, e.g., [lintcode/115_unique_paths_ii.py](../../lintcode/115_unique_paths_ii.py)
- cache previous cell, e.g., [other/unique_paths_with_followups.py](../../other/unique_paths_with_followups.py)

## Print Paths

- 1D example: [leetcode/300_longest_increasing_subsequence.py](../../leetcode/300_longest_increasing_subsequence.py)
- 2D example: [lintcode/168_burst_balloons.py](../../lintcode/168_burst_balloons.py)
